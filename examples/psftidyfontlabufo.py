__doc__ = '''Make changes to a backup UFO to match some changes made to another UFO by FontLab
When a UFO is first round-tripped through Fontlab 7, many changes are made including adding 'smooth="yes"' to many points
in glifs and removing it from others.  Also if components are after contours in a glif, then they get moved to before them.
These changes make initial comparisons hard and can mask other changes.  
This script takes the backup of the original font that Fontlab made and writes out a new version with contours changed 
to match those in the round-tripped UFO so a diff can then be done to look for other differences.
A glif is only changed if there are no other changes to contours.
If also moves components to match.
