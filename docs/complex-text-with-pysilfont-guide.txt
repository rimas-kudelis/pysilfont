Pysilfont can be used interactively with ipython in the form of a Jupyter Notebook. 

# Installing the notebook and its dependencies

(assuming we have a virtualenv in venv already)

source ../venv/bin/activate
pip install notebook PyGObject

ipython kernel install --user --name=venv

# Using the notebook
start in by typing:

```
jupyter notebook complex-text-with-pysilfont.ipynb
```

Make sure you select the right kernel in the Menu:
Kernel -> Change kernel... venv


Bear in mind, the nature of notebooks means that path variables are not accessible, so you will have to adjust paths to point to your previously downloaded files yourself. (Change nico to your own username in the path).
